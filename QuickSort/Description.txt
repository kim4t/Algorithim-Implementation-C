Implementation of quick sort with different pivot.

This algorithm will show that the position of pivot will affect the time spending of quick sort.

It has 4 main file (qsortf, qsortl, qsortm and qsortr).
It means set the pivot as first element, last element, median element, and random element, respectively.

If you run each main file, then you can get the number of comparison which affect the time spending of quick sort.
The size of the array is 200000.

below is output.

Pivot is first.
Number of comparison: 4278149

Pivot is last.
Number of comparison: 4231149

Pivot is median.
Number of comparison: 3675415

Pivot is random.
Number of comparison: 4345803


The quick sort has the best efficiency when the array is distributed as equally as possible based on the pivot.

You can change size of the array and elements in array by changing number in srand function.
