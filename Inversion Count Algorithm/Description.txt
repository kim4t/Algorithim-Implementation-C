Implementation of inversion count algorithm

I implemented two way to figure out the inversion count.

1. Naive (brute force) algorithm (a4b)
2. Using merge sort piggyback idea (a4m)

If algorithm is run on Linux machine, the test command will be ./a4b <data-set-size>  or  ./a4m <data-set-size>
No matter what the way to find inversion count, the inversion count should be same. 
The key difference between two methods is time spending. 
We can notice that using merge sort piggyback idea spend much less time. 
Brute force algorithm has O(n^2) time complexity but merge sort piggyback algorithm has O(nlogn) time complexity.
